# Intruder Detection and Video feedback using TurtleBot3

## Guide: Robotics Club, IIT Tirupati

In this exciting project, I modified the TurtleBot3 waffle equipped with the capability to autonomously navigate to locate objects or intruders in a custom built simulated Gazebo world. This autonomous robot was designed to intelligently avoid obstacles while providing real-time video feedback of its path. The entire system is powered by the Robot Operating System (ROS), which serves as the communication framework between the components and the TurtleBot3 robot.

### Key Features and Technologies:
- **_Autonomous Navigation:_** The TurtleBot3 is programmed to navigate autonomously within its environment, making decisions to avoid obstacles and reach its destination. This capability is essential for various applications, including surveillance and exploration.
- **_Object Detection:_** Using computer vision techniques, the TurtleBot3 is equipped to detect objects or intruders within its surroundings. This feature enhances its utility in security and monitoring tasks.
- **_Live Video Feedback:_** The robot provides real-time video feedback of its path, allowing operators to monitor its movements and the objects it encounters. This feedback is crucial for remote surveillance and decision-making.
- **_ROS Integration:_** The Robot Operating System (ROS) serves as the communication backbone of this project. It enables seamless coordination between various hardware and software components, ensuring the robot's efficient operation.
- **_Gazebo Simulation:_** To test and validate the robot's capabilities, I utilized Gazebo, a powerful robot simulation tool. Gazebo allows for realistic testing in a virtual environment before deploying the robot in the real world.
